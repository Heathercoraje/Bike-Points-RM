## Our Product:

We want to create a web application which displays the number of availiable bikes and the number of spaces to park a park throughout each bike point throughout London.

## User Story:

### As someone who rides a bike in London

* I would like to know availiable spaces to drop my bike off
* I would like to know how many bikes are availiable in each location throughout London

### Stretch Goal:
* Much time spent on CSS Design. Particularly mastering box-shadows.
* Add autocomplete function as well
